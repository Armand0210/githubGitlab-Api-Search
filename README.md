# githubGitlab-Api-Search <br/>

In this project I created a full-stack web application that interfaces with the GitHub and GitLab API's. <br/>

Implemented the following features: <br/>
  ● User search box - with results from all three platforms. <br/>
  ● User details - including some of their repos, their profile picture, bio, etc. <br/>
  ● Repo details - including last commit date, creation date, description, etc. <br/>
  
Helmet was also used to secure the Express app.
