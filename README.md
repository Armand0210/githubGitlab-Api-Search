# githubGitlab-Api-Search

In this project I created a full-stack web application that interfaces with the GitHub and GitLab API's.

Implemented the following features:
  ● User search box - with results from all three platforms.
  ● User details - including some of their repos, their profile picture, bio, etc.
  ● Repo details - including last commit date, creation date, description, etc.
  
Helmet was also used to secure the Express app.
